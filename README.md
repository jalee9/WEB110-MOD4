# 🌟 Personal Portfolio Website Project

Welcome to your Personal Portfolio Website project! Follow these instructions to create an impressive online portfolio.

## 📚 Instructions

### 1. Create a Template and Home Page
Complete the "Consider This: Your Turn" task #1 in Chapter 2 (page 81) of your textbook.
- If you already have a template, use that to build your Personal Portfolio Website.

### 2. Add Images and Links
Complete the "Consider This: Your Turn" task #1 in Chapter 3 (page 139) of your textbook, steps 1 through 11.

### Hints:
- Task 2 builds on Task 1. Complete the steps in order.
- Save your work anywhere on your computer.
- Use **relative paths** instead of absolute paths to ensure your site is portable.
  - See the web link in Blackboard for more on relative and absolute paths.

## 📂 Deliverables

1. **Upload your work** to the `wcet.waketech.edu` server.
2. **Include support files** such as images.
3. **Submit a clickable URL** pointing to your `.html` file in the assignment submission box below.
4. **IMPORTANT:** Always test your assignment submission for proper content and functionality.

## ❗ Important Notes

- Please **do not email** your instructor to review your work before it's due. It's not equitable or fair to all students.
- Always **review project requirements** in the lesson folder and the grading rubric before submitting assignments to Blackboard.
- **Submission of this assessment** means it is ready for grading. Your instructor may grade projects before the due date.
- You have **one submission attempt**. Any problems? Notify your instructor immediately.

## 📅 Timeline
Make sure you manage your time efficiently to complete both tasks and submit your assignment on time.

### Good luck, and happy coding! 🎉

Hints:

    Item 2 above builds on item 1. Please complete the steps in order.
    Save your work anywhere you like on your computer. Make sure your site is portable by using relative paths instead of absolute paths. (See web link in Blackboard on relative and absolute paths).

    Upload your work to the wcet.waketech.edu server.
    Be sure to upload any support files such as image files.
    Submit a clickable URL that points to your .html file in the assignment submission box below.
    IMPORTANT: always test your assignment submission for proper content and functionality.


Please do not email your instructor to review your work before it's due. It's not an equitable or fair request since the same opportunity cannot be extended to everyone in the class. Always review project requirements in the lesson folder as well as the grading rubric before submitting assignments to Blackboard for grading.


Submission of this assessment means it is ready for grading. Your instructor may grade projects before the due date. You have one submission attempt. Any problems notify your instructor immediately.
